# Mosaica
## Overview
Mosaica is an app that allows users practice written Spanish by drilling on different families of verbs and different tenses. Mosaica keeps track of a user's recent performance and displays it in an easy to understand grid. The grid also serves as the menu from which to select which verbs and tenses to drill on.
